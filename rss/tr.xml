</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Here's a free trial version of isoland 3 with in-app purchases to unlock the full game. Download and enjoy the beginning of the game for free! If you like it, you can support our development and unlock the remaining chapters through a one-time purchase. Thank you for your support!

At the end of ISOLAND 2, the rocket is finally launched into the space.
So what happens next?

In the third installment of ISOLAND franchise, the player has an opportunity to explore the story even further, which is also an opportunity for ourselves to test our curiosity and creativity.

I would like to footnote ISOLAND 3 with my favorite artist Maurits Cornelis Escher, 
to explain the significance of art.
Every player of ISOLAND now is able to set off again with his curiosity.
I wish you all find the answer to your love when you complete the game.

Coming with the art style you are familiar with, various puzzles, delicately designed 2nd run mode, and interesting collectables.

You've been traveling through the universe by rocket and come to an uncharted planet. This place is covered with rocks and barren vegetation. What lies above the blue ocean is a bizarre, crimson sky. However, you are not the only human being who have been here. Along your path you will encounter ancient ruins, a mysterious spaceship, and countless puzzles to solve.

What are you going to do this time?
