</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Imagine that the entire globe is at your fingertips. Never before has getting weather information been as exciting and interactive as it is in the ‚ÄúWeather Now‚Äù application.
Amazingly beautiful 3D images of our planet draws your attention for so long that you may forget that the application has other useful features that allows you easy access to precise, global weather information.

The main features of ‚ÄúWeather Now‚Äù are the ‚Äúhome screen‚Äù and the forecast page with a unique way of scaling the charts. On the ‚Äúhome screen‚Äù, you can get information on the selected location such as local time and current weather with detailed weather conditions, and, of course, an incredibly beautiful three-dimensional image of the globe with realistic-looking atmosphere, the sun and the stars. You can manually turn it, increase and decrease its size, run the slow spinning animation or stop it. Installed in a cradle or dock station, the application can run as a screensaver, attracting your friends and fellows.

The weather forecast is provided by CustomWeather, Inc,¬†an American weather provider of global weather information for over 11 years.¬†CustomWeather is a leader in technology and meteorological innovation, providing local weather information to companies and application developers around the world.

The current weather data is gathered from thousands of professionally installed and maintained weather stations installed mostly at airports. WeatherNow only shows current weather from stations that have reported local weather conditions within the past hour. Current weather data is refreshed every 30 minutes; that is twice as frequent as most other weather providers can offer. Unique 48-hour forecasts from over 80,000 locations around the world provide a level of coverage and detail that simply cannot be found elsewhere.

Current weather information includes: description, air temperature, wind direction and force, humidity, dew point, pressure, visibility, as well as comfort index with reference to current weather conditions.¬†
Detailed weather forecast information includes: description, day and night air temperature, wind direction and force, humidity, UV index, probability of precipitation, and comfort index with reference to current weather conditions.
