  Get things done! The award-winning Things app helps you plan your day, manage your projects, and make real progress toward your goals.

Best of all, it‚Äôs easy to use. Within the hour, you‚Äôll have everything off your mind and neatly organized‚Äîfrom routine tasks to your biggest life goals‚Äîand you can start focusing on what matters today.

‚ÄúThings offers the best combination of design and functionality of any app we tested, with nearly all the features of other power user applications and a delightful interface that never gets in the way of your work.‚Äù
‚ÄîWirecutter, The New York Times


KEY FEATURES

‚Ä¢ Your To-Dos
Your basic building block is the almighty To-Do‚Äîeach a small step toward a great accomplishment. You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.

‚Ä¢ Your Projects
Create a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There‚Äôs also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.

‚Ä¢ Your Areas
Create an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.

‚Ä¢ Your Plan
Everything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)
