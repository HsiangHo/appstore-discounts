</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  iSleeper only requires your mobile phone to complete sleep monitoring, and can accurately record the user's sleeping habits and sleep cycles through neural network algorithms.

‚óé Sleep Recording
We display your sleep recordings on a timeline to maximize the recreation of your sleep. We record various sleep sounds, including snoring, sleep talking,chewing, walking, coughing, sneezing, turning over, sighing, cat meowing, dog barking, bird chirping, and rooster crowing. All recordings are stored only on your phone, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about your sleep recordings being leaked.

‚óé Smart Alarm Clock
iSleeper alarm on iPhone supports light sleep wake-up, snooze, and voice control to turn off the snooze alarm. We will wake you up when you are in light sleep within the set time range, and you can turn off the snooze alarm with voice control, and sleep for a while until the final alarm rings. The final alarm needs to be turned off manually. (See "Me" -> "Alarm Settings" for details)
The iSleeper alarm on Apple Watch supports light sleep wake-up. We will wake you up when you are in light sleep within the set time range.

‚óé Sleep Monitoring
We use neural network algorithms to more accurately analyze your sleep cycle and generate a sleep monitoring chart, which includes your sleep score, sleep duration, time in bed, time to fall asleep, time awake, number of awakenings, sleep goal completion, wake time, REM sleep, core sleep, and deep sleep. If you wear an Apple Watch, the analysis page will generate detailed charts for sleep heart rate variability, sleep heart rate, sleep respiratory rate, sleep blood oxygen, and sleep environmental noise.

‚óé Comprehensive Statistics
On the statistics page, you can easily view your sleep trends by week, month, and year. We have also added features for the best sleep day and the worst sleep day, so you can clearly see related information. Understand and analyze the factors affecting your sleep from the trends to improve your sleep.

‚óé Automatic Sleep Tracking
If you wear an Apple Watch while sleeping, just turn on sleep mode, and iSleeper will automatically generate nightly sleep records without needing to open iSleeper on your phone.
