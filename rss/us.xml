Other Introduction

-four quadrant work rules

The four-quadrant rule is a time management theory put forward by Stephen covey, a famous management scientist. Stephen covey has divided work into two different degrees of importance and urgency, basically into four quadrants: [urgent and important], [important but not urgent], [urgent but not important], [neither urgent nor important]. In order of processing: first urgent and important, then important but not urgent, then urgent but not important, and finally neither urgent nor important.

The core of the traditional time management method is "urgency"

The core of efficient time management: first priority, then priority
