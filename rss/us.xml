</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Download and play Bully: Anniversary Edition for up to thirty minutes as a free trial. Purchase the full game as a one-time, in-app purchase to play without any time limits. GTA+ Members can enjoy unlimited access while subscribed for as long as it is included in GTA+.

The Anniversary Edition of Bully has been designed for mobile compatibility and includes four bonus classes and additional non-storyline missions in addition to everything from the original Bully release. 

The Rockstar tradition of groundbreaking, original gameplay, and tongue-in-cheek storytelling invades the schoolyard.  
 
As a mischievous teenager, Jimmy Hopkins, you‚Äôll stand up to bullies, take on the liars, cheats, and snobs who are the most popular members of the student body and faculty at Bullworth Academy ‚Äî the corrupt and crumbling prep school with an uptight fa√ßade ‚Äî and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of life in the worst school around.  
 
If you can survive the school year and outsmart your rivals, you could rule the school. 


Mobile version developed in conjunction with War Drum Studios.
