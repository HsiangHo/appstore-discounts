‚ñ† Story

In ancient times, a natural disaster brought the Sun from high in the Sky to the depths of the Ocean, allowing a mysterious dark fog to blanket the World. 
 
Simultaneously, Colossi, beings that were revered by descendants, roamed the lands for the very first time. 
 
These Colossi, which emit the sparks of light that disperse the black fog, bring the only hope to mankind. 
 
Thousands of years later, humanity has long grown accustomed to following in the footsteps of these revered beings as they travel through the black fog. 
 
However, just as how the Sun was mysteriously brought down from the Sky, these Colossi have also began to fall mysteriously...
 
Terrence, a courier whom was expelled by the Church, has learned that his long estranged wife Teresa, may have some connection to the recent fall of the Colossi. 
 
Setting forth on a journey filled with anguish, deception and possible redemption, Terrence seeks to find his wife and the truth behind their World.
