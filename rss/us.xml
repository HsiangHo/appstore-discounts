  "Cytus II" is a music rhythm game created by Rayark Games. It's our fourth rhythm game title, following the footsteps of three global successes, "Cytus", "DEEMO" and "VOEZ". This sequel to "Cytus" brings back the original staff and is a product of hardwork and devotion. 

In the future, humans have redefined internet development and connections. We can now easily sync the real world with the internet world, changing life as we have known for thousands of years. 

In the mega virtual internet space cyTus, there exists a mysterious DJ legend √Üsir. His music has an irresistible charm; people fall madly in love with his music. Rumor has it that every note and beat of his music hits the audiences in 
the depths of their souls. 

One day, √Üsir, who had never shown his face before, suddenly announced that he will be holding the first mega virtual concert ‚Äî‚Äî √Üsir-FEST and will invite a top idol singer and a popular DJ as opening performances. The instant the ticket sales began, an unprecedented rush occurred. Everyone wanted to see √Üsir's real face. 

On the day of the FEST,  millions of people were connected to the event. At one hour before the event started,  the previous world record for most simultaneous connection was smashed. The whole city was on its feet, waiting for √Üsir to descent from the skies...
