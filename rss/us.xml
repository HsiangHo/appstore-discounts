</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Hey there! We're the team behind Boom 3D, and we've created the ultimate Safari extension to give you an incredible Netflix experience. With our extension, you can enjoy high-quality 5.1 surround sound and 1080p video with compatible content on Netflix. The accompanying Boom3D desktop app will take your sound to a whole new level of immersion and realism with our patented 3D audio technology, and it works with absolutely ANY headphones.

But why is 5.1 surround sound so great? Well, when you're watching a movie or show, you want to feel like you're right in the middle of the action, right? 5.1 surround sound does exactly that. With five separate audio channels plus a subwoofer channel, you get a more realistic and immersive audio experience. You can hear every detail, from subtle whispers to thunderous explosions, and feel like you're right in the middle of the scene.

We created this extension to help you take your Netflix experience to the next level. By enabling 5.1 output, you can enjoy a more immersive and cinematic viewing experience, all from the comfort of your own home.

It's important to note that the 5.1 audio can only be enabled on compatible content. 1080p video can only be enabled on select Netflix plans and require sufficient internet bandwidth.

Overall, we're really excited about the Safari extension, and we hope you are too! So what are you waiting for? 
Enable the extension and start experiencing your favorite shows and movies like never before.
