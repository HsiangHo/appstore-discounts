‚Ä¢ On-Screen Playback: Watch YouTube videos while using other apps.
‚Ä¢ Audio-Only Mode: Listen to any YouTube video with your screen locked.
‚Ä¢ Auto Shutdown: Set a sleep timer. (Premium)
‚Ä¢ Loop Mode: Automatically repeat your favorite videos.
‚Ä¢ Learning Mode: Learn languages using subtitles. (Premium)

It also includes essential features such as playlists, speed adjustment (improved), related videos, AirPlay, and more to enhance your video-watching experience.

¬ª HOW TO USE PLAYNAV?

ON-SCREEN PLAYBACK (PIP) (Premium)

Watch YouTube videos while using any other app. Once activated, the player will shrink on your screen, allowing you to move or hide it with a double tap.

¬ª How to activate it?
1. While playing a video, tap the PIP icon in the upper-left corner (two small screen icons).
2. While a video is playing, swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone, and the player will appear on your screen.

AUDIO-ONLY MODE

Listen to the audio of your favorite YouTube videos with your iPhone screen locked. Use it while exercising, walking, or before bed. Combine it with the auto shutdown feature to relax while listening to your favorite videos!

¬ª How to activate it?
1. Enable On-Screen Playback.
2. Then, lock your iPhone, and the audio will continue playing.

2. Select the time you want for auto shutdown.

LOOP MODE (REPEAT VIDEO)

Want your video to play on repeat? Use Loop Mode to replay your video as many times as you like. You can also combine it with Audio-Only Mode.

¬ª How to activate it?
1. Tap the Repeat icon. Your video will keep playing on loop until you disable it.
